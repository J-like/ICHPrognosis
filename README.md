Note--The code is not yet fully organized and is currently mainly provided for researchers to reproduce the model, along with example data and sample tables. Once the paper “Multi-modal Deep Learning for Predicting Functional Outcomes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using 3D CT and Clinical Data” is officially accepted, we will further refine the reproduction workflow instructions and upload the model weights to support more comprehensive reproduction and application by the community.
