## Multi-modal Deep Learning for Predicting Functional Outcomes in ICH

This repository provides the **model code and pretrained weights** used in our study, including:

1. **Model code**  
2. **nnU-Net v2 segmentation model weights** (trained on our dataset)  
3. **Multi-modal prognostic prediction model weights**

### üîó Download Weights

All weights are hosted on Google Drive:

Note: The BioClinicalBERT pretrained model used in our code is from HuggingFace:

### üöÄ Usage

1. Replace the dataset with your own data, and organize it following the directory format in the example files.  
2. *(Optional)* If you need to perform 3D CT skull stripping using nnU-Net v2, you can download our pretrained nnU-Net v2 segmentation weights. For further steps, please refer to the official documentation: [nnU-Net v2 GitHub](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).  
3. Start training with the following command:  
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Due to the heterogeneity of data from different medical centers, we recommend retraining the model on your own dataset.  
- `.pth` files only contain the **model weights**. Please ensure that the model definition matches the training phase when loading them.  
- nnU-Net v2 models must follow the official framework‚Äôs path conventions.  
- BioClinicalBERT should be downloaded separately from HuggingFace and loaded during runtime.
