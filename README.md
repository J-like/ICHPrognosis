Note--The code is not yet fully organized and is currently provided primarily for researchers to reproduce our results, along with example data and sample tables. Once the paper *“Multi-modal Deep Learning for Predicting Functional Outcomes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using 3D CT and Clinical Data”* is officially accepted, we will further refine the reproduction workflow instructions and upload the model weights to facilitate more comprehensive reproduction and application by the community.
